    answer:
      - "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose."
      - "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."
      - "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is."
      - "Always pass on what you have learned."
      - "You will know (the good from the bad) when you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
      - "Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice."
      - "[Luke:] I can’t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail."
      - "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you."
      - "If you end your training now — if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did — you will become an agent of evil."
      - "PATIENCE YOU MUST HAVE my young padawan"
      - "Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless."
      - "Feel the force!"
      - "Remember, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
      - "Luke… Luke… do not… do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father’s fate you will. Luke, when gone am I… the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is… another… Sky… walker."
      - "Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will."
      - "You must unlearn what you have learned."
      - "In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way."
      - "When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back."
      - "You will know (the good from the bad) when you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
      - "Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view."
      - "Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future…the past. Old friends long gone."
      - "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is."
      - "The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side."
      - "A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things."
      - "Do or do not. There is no try."
      - "You will find only what you bring in."
      - "May the Force be with you."
      - "Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship."
      - "Ohhh. Great warrior. Wars not make one great."
      - "Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice."
      - "Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.."
      - "I have many children, as you seek you may find that this the last one till he must die before he must reach the becoming of mankind. Many men have failed but i have surpassed their expectation of being a Jedi master."
      - "Looking? Found someone you have, eh?"
      - "If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find."
      - "You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? A teacher Yoda is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink, like killers kill."
      - "Luke: What’s in there? Yoda: Only what you take with you."
      - "The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is."
